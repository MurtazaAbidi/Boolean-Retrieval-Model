# Boolean-Retrieval-Model

The objective of Boolean Retrival Model is to understand how different indexes work in retrieving different query from a collection. We create Inverted index and Positional index for a set of collection to facilitate Boolean Model of IR. Inverted files and positional files are the primary data structure to support the efficient determination of which documents contain specified terms and at which proximity.
